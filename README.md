# The AI Personal Brand Architect - Prompt Library

**Mission:** To provide an expert-level "master prompt" that empowers anyone to generate compelling content for a professional portfolio website using AI.

### The Problem

Building a personal website is hard. Writing about yourself is even harder. This project solves that problem by providing a master prompt that directs an AI to act as your personal Brand Strategist, turning your simple resume into a step-by-step plan for building a website.

 ### **A Note From The Creator**

"I started this project because I saw many talented people who deserved a great website but didn't have one. This prompt is my contribution to making professional branding accessible to everyone."

### How It Works

This project does not require any code. The process is simple:

1.  **Choose the Master Prompt:** Start with the "AI Website Building Roadmap" prompt below.
2.  **Add Your Info:** Copy the text from your resume, CV, or LinkedIn profile and paste it into the designated section of the prompt.
3.  **Generate Your Plan:** Paste the complete text (prompt + your info) into an AI Chat tool like ChatGPT, Claude, or Google's Gemini. The AI will then generate a detailed, step-by-step "Building Roadmap" for you.
4.  **Build Your Website:** Take the commands from the "Building Roadmap" and paste them one-by-one into a conversational AI website builder like **Lovable AI**.
